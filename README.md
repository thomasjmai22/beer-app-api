Pair is primarily a beer app that generates a list of different types of beer while providing the user information about the flavor, 
the ingredients such as hops and malts as well as additional tips for the user to consider when brewing/purchasing. In addition, the API provides data on which
foods are recommended with that particular beer to complement the taste and experience. Pair simply "pairs" the beer with the recommended food/recipe through 
another API which provides a database of recipes. Combining these two API's allows users who are lovers of beer and good food to match their beverage with 
their meal.

This app was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and utilizing two different API's called PunkAPI for the beer and Edamam for the recipes.
